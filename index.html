		  <h1>The Accomplishments of Satoru Iwata</h1>
		  <h4>Pokemon</h4>
		  <p>Iwata was responsible for the digital compression of the Pokemon Gold and Silver games, allowing more content to be added. He also helped to port over the combat mechanics of the Game Boy games to the Nintendo 64 with Pokemon Stadium.</p>
		  <h4>Nintendo DS</h4>
		  <p>The Nintendo DS is the best-selling handheld gaming console with over 154 million units sold. This was one of Iwata's first projects after becoming President of Nintendo.</p>
		  <h4>Kirby's Dream Land</h4>
		  <p>Kirby's Dream Land was one of HAL Laboratories' first projects, which would introduce a renown Nintendo mascot to the family as well as help rocket fellow designer Sakurai to stardom.</p>
		  <h4>Nintendo Wii</h4>
		  <p>After the success of the Nintendo DS, Iwata wanted to focus on introducing the casual audience to gaming. With that, Nintendo would produce the Nintendo Wii, a motion-control based gaming console that would appeal to many casual gamers, helping it to rocket to skyhigh sales.</p>
		  <h4>Super Smash Bros. Melee</h4>
		  <p>Iwata's final personal involvement with game development would come in the form of Nintendo's premier fighting-game franchise, Super Smash Bros. His work on code review and debugging allowed the game to launch on time, helping it to become the Gamecube's most sold game.</p>
